Question 1 answer...

Version Control Systems (VCS) are useful when developing software for both individuals and as part of a development team. A VCS takes “snapshots” of files at different stages as they are being worked on.

A very basic example of this would be by saving files using different name or version numbers to identify the different stages of development e.g., document_v1_01-Jan-23.txt, document_v2_10-Jan-23.txt, document_v3_23-Feb-23.txt etc. Naming files in this way can be easy to read and may be all that is required for small scale projects. The issues with carrying out version control in this way is that there is no description of changes made between each document. The only way to know what the differences are is to open both documents and manually compare the differences. This VCS also does not describe the scale of the changes that have been made between each document. It way be that some of the changes were very minor making it harder to identify the differences between the versions. These issues can also make it harder to revert to a previous version of the document as it can be difficult to work out the date that specific updates were made to each document version.

A VCS such as GitHub addresses these issues by recording each change that was made between versions and what date and time that the changes were made. This allows the user to quickly identify when a particular change was made and revert the file back to that version if required.

VCS was originally designed for dealing with code but it can be used for many other types of work such as tracking changes in documents. VCS can also allow you to experiment with changes to existing files by creating a branch. A branch is a parallel line of development where changes can be made to code or documentation. These changes can then be merged back into the main branch at a later point once they are ready.

Version control was originally intended to allow development groups to work together on large projects. Branches allow multiple developers to work simultaneously on the same files and merge the changes together once each has completed their part. When merging files in this way, the VCS checks for conflicts between the documents that are to be merged. The conflicts can then be edited or cleaned up by the developers before completing the merge request.

Dropbox and GoogleDrive also have basic forms of version control in their systems however they are not quite as powerful as something like Git. Git supports both text and programming languages and so offers more versatility in support for version control. The branches mentioned earlier are also a significant improvement over Dropbox and GoogleDrive as it allows for easier document control. Finally, Git has a more useful history making it easier to track when changes were made by each contributor and on which branch.
